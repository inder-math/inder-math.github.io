**Dust morphology and its impact on the aerosol optics, reactive uptake of trace gases and UV-Vis trace gas retrievals**\
\
Mineral dust is often treated as spherical in chemical transport and trace gas retrieval models. We investigate how dust shape affects gas-particle and radiation-particle interactions. We examine the impact of dust shape on optical properties and trace gas retrievals at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths. We find that treating dust as nonspherical in trace gas retrievals of nitrogen dioxide decreases the retrieval sensitivity to dust. We also examine the impact of dust shape on heterogeneous chemistry by developing and applying a theoretical model. We find that dust pores change particle surface area significantly and subsequently, reaction and diffusion parameters. Overall, this study signifies the importance of accounting for nonsphericity in chemical transport and trace gas retrieval models.
