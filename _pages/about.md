Welcome to my website!!
I am a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis working in the [Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG)](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/) led by [Dr. Randall Martin](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Randall-Martin.html). My research interest involves solving real world problems related to air quality and atmospheric sciences using physics-based approach. My research includes the efficient representation of aerosols in the chemical transport model [GEOS-Chem](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html).
