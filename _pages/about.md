Welcome to my website!\
I am a graduate student at Washington University in St. Louis working in the [Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG)](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/) led by [Dr. Randall Martin](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Randall-Martin.html). My research focuses on the efficient representation of aerosols in the chemical transport model [GEOS-Chem](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html) and UV-Vis trace gas retrieval models in order to understand the processes affecting atmospheric composition and air quality.
