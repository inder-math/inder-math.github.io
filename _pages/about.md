Welcome to my website!\
\
I am a PhD student at Washington University in St. Louis working in the [Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG)](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/) led by [Dr. Randall Martin](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Randall-Martin.html). My research interests involve developing the analytical and physics-based approaches to understand the processes affecting atmospheric composition and air quality. My research focuses primarily on the efficient representation of aerosols in the chemical transport model [GEOS-Chem](https://geoschem.github.io/index.html) and UV-Vis trace gas retrieval models.\
\
Prior joining the ACAG, I received my masters in Earth System Science and Technology from [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur)](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). I worked with [Dr. ANV Satayanarayanan](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/CL/faculty/cl-anvsatya) on investigating the role of the turbulent coherent structures in transporting the heat and momentum fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer using wavelet techniques as a part of my dissertation.\
\
Apart from my research interest, I enjoy roadtrips, gym, and science documentries.
